// Non-blocking policy (single source of truth for all replication paths): a
// completed_with_failures outcome does NOT abort replication. Documents that
// violate a basic conversion rule (e.g. a field over Firestore's size limit, a
// reserved key/collection name) are captured in the DLQ with their error reason;
// every other document migrates normally and the caller proceeds straight to
// incremental replication. Failed documents are recovered afterwards with
// `-mode retry-dlq` (optionally re-reading the fixed source doc), or — while a
// live job is still running — automatically, when the user's source edit produces
// a change event that succeeds and writes a resolution tombstone.
//
// The returned status is still recorded in the initial-migration state file for
// reporting, and the pre-run resume gate continues to refuse to *resume* a
// completed_with_failures state (that guard prevents silently skipping an
// unfinished initial load); this helper only governs whether THIS run proceeds.
