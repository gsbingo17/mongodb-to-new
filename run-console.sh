# Console watchdog: keeps the migration console reachable even if the process dies.
# The root-cause crash (change stream Next racing Close on stop) is fixed and the
# reader goroutine now recovers from panics, but this supervisor is belt-and-braces:
# if the console exits for ANY reason it is relaunched within a couple of seconds so
# the UI never gets stuck at "Failed to fetch".
#
# NOTE: a restart only revives the HTTP console. An in-flight migration job lives in
# the process's memory, so if a crash ever happens mid-migration the job itself is
# gone — you re-launch it from the form. For a planned halt use 暂停 (pause), not a
# process kill.
#
# Usage:  ./run-console.sh [addr]      (default addr :9090)
